            <h3>My name's Genesis Parreño Sulleza</h3>
            <p>
                Seventeen years old and striving to become a computer engineering student someday. My hobbies are mainly tinkering with random things I find that interests me, and randomly, geography. I'm known for my skills when it comes to computers and such and I'm also a heavy procrastinator, but manages to cram all of it in time. I value my life very much and would spend all of it to have fun rather than to have stressing on things.

            <h1>The purpose</h1>
            <p>This e-portfolio serves as a digital showcase of my reading and writing skills developed throughout the 3rd Quarter of the Second Semester of my Grade 11 years. It reflects my growth as a reader and writer, demonstrating my ability to understand, learn and go back to the basic concepts on the structure of the english language. It also serves me to learn about netwroking and nerdy computer things like that.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Reading has had a detremental part of my life. When I was a toddler, I was taught by my mother how to read on a very young age and it greatly helped me expand my knowledge on a lot of things from an early age.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is reading?</h3>
            <p>Well, in my definition of reading, it is a way to encode or take in the symbols or words you are reading, and then decoding it to understand what is the meaning of said symbols.</p>

            <h3>A way to communicate</h3>
            <p align-text: justify; >What I think is useful about reading is that, in our modern society, we tend to appreciate more of our technological advancements when it comes to communication. To be specific, communication with far away distances. Back then, we wrote letters to people, use telegram, and before all of those well structured messaging systems, we used to use the smoke to signal meanings, and someone transcribes it. Basically, without reading, we'll probably be stuck in the stone age.</p>

            <p>Without reading, how can't there be writing? History and cultures would be lost since we can't record it. The word of mouth only has a short lifespan as it will later grow old. And we'll basically not learn from all our mistakes.'</p>

            <h2>Stages of Reading</h2>
            <p>The stages of reading are the different stages on which, you develop or what is your progress on a secific text you are to read. From the very start of the text where you are introduced, to starting to read the text, up to the end of the text.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>There are three stages of reading</h3>
            <p>*Pre-reading</p>
            <p>*During reading</p>
            <p>*Post-reading</p>

            <h2>Pre-Reading</h2>
            <p>Pre-reading is the stage where you prepare yourself before diving into a text. It involves activities like looking at the title, thinking about what you already know on the topic, making guesses about the content, and skimming through headings or images. This helps you get a sense of what to expect and makes it easier to understand the material when you start reading.
            - This is where you are introduced to a text
            <br>
            - Question the intentions of the author's background
            <br>
            - Question the author's reason
            <br>
            - Looking at the sypnosis (a breif summary of the text)'</p>

            <h2>During Reading</h2>
            <p>During reading is the stage where you actively engage with the text. It involves reading and sometimes rereading to fully grasp the content. This includes figuring out the meanings of unfamiliar words, checking your understanding, making notes, thinking about what you’re reading, and drawing conclusions based on the information. This helps you stay focused and understand the material more deeply.
            <br>
            - Reading the full text
            <br>
            - Comprehend, Annotate, Reflect, Infer on the text

            <h2>Post-Reading</h2>
            <p>Post-reading is the stage where you review and reflect on what you’ve read. It involves checking your understanding, summarizing the main points, thinking about the content, rewording ideas in your own words, creating visual aids like charts or diagrams, and writing about your thoughts or reactions. This helps solidify your understanding and retain the information better.
            <br>
            - Check if you understand the text

            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p align-text: justify; >I'll be brutally honest here, I am the type of person that does'nt store all my learnings in long-term peroids of time and forget about it in like two days or so. So, in this part, let us review what are the differences between what's a topic sentence and what's a Thesis statement, and even if you remind me about what is a thesis statement like three times a week, best chances are, I would forget the meaning and move on.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, discussion time, a topic sentence is the main idea or the central point of a paragraph. It supports, explain or elaborate on the given topic with details, examples and evidences. Meanwhile a thesis statement is a concise summary of the main point or claim of an academic text. Thesis statments are basically made up of several topic sentences and it is usually located in the end of an introduction. It outlines the central argument or purpose, giving a clear guide or outline of the text and it must be supportable and debatable. One thing for certain is that the two all share the purpose of providing clarity and direction: the thesis statement guides the reader through the entire essay, while topic sentences help organize and develop the argument paragraph by paragraph. Together, they ensure coherence and logical flow in writing.</p>

            <h2>Types of Reading</h2>
            <p>Every person has a reason to read. People read because they develop a broad background, to anticipate and predict, create motication and interest, to widen their vocabulary, for pleasure and enjoyment, and to copy and paste the slide that explains "why do we read" and intepreting it on this breif explination. Basically, reading is detremental to us as it serves a lot of purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>There is also 3 types of reading</h3>
            <p>*Pleasure Reading</p>
            <p>*Functional Reading</p>
            <p>*Remedial Reading</p>
            <br>
            <p>They are all self explinatory subjects, but just to give the gist of it, Pleasure reading is where you read for entertainment and enjoyment; Functional reading is used for understanding practical information, such as reading signs, menus, instructions, and labels; and Remedial reading is used for correcting poor teaching and learning.

            <h2>Skimming</h2>
            <p>Skimming is a skill that basically aims to get the main idea and overview of a text by reading through it quickly. It is a type of rapid reading and sometimes require you to use your finger as a guide to glide to the words. It mainly focuses on the first and last sentences and paragraphs.</p>

            <h2>Locate the main Idea</h2>
            <p>Locating the main idea involves the identification of the central message. The main idea is usually found in the end of an introduction and usually has supporting details.</p>

            <h2>Previewing</h2>
            <p>Scanning is another type of rapid reading. It is a skill where, during reading, the reader finds a specific information and avoids extras.</p>

            <h2>Literal Reading</h2>
            <p>Literal reading is already self explanitory. You basically read all of the given material and understand the ideas and facts of the contents of the given text. You are only understanding on the given material and only on that material. And during-reading, you can take notes, summarize and paraphrase your ideas.</p>

            <h2>Inferential Reading</h2>
            <p>Inferential Reading where you make assumptions to an open-ended story. You make your own conclusions, or endings.</p>

            <h2>Summarizing</h2>
            <p>It is where the reader annotate or to condense a paragraph in bite-sized peices to be read. Usually, you condense 15-70% of the text.</p>

            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p align-text: justify; >Back when I was in grade ten, I have just learned that summarizing and paraphrasing was two different things altogether which, quite frankly, startled me. All those years of thinking they are just the same things, made me think about all of those grade 9 Paraphrasing I made basically summarizing them via bulletpoints. So, let us not confuse the two of them and learn what the two differences is.
            <br>
            So, summarizing, it is the act of restating the main ideas of a text in your own words, in a shorter, more concise form. Meanwhile Paraphrasing estating someone else's ideas or information in your own words. See the differences now? Summarizing requires you to make a paragraph or sentence simpler, while paraphrasing is where you remake the whole sentence, and depending on how long or short your sentence is, it must atleast have the same intended meaning.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Since we have the privilege to have freedom of speech to express our opinions on our reflection. Let’s just say that the first meeting was very tense. I heard rumors from sources I won’t disclose that you, sir, were somewhat of a strict teacher, something like that. First day and already, we were bombarded with a lot of questions about the topic, where, we were pointed by our names to answer, albeit such simple questions. It was quite a scare this is quite an unusual teaching style since every topic that is discussed a minuite ago; I sometimes ask questions like “What if I got it wrong?” since the aura you're emitting is quite heavy, It made me quite hella anxious.
                <br>
The lesson I learned on the class is that if you don’t listen and doze off, you’re pretty much screwed and have nothing to answer on the question (unless you have good long-term memory on your previous lessons) no one’s going to help you. Reading is another important skill that we need to learn. Reading allows us to understand and connect with the writers words and learn new words you may not even know of. I’ll admit it, I am a very slow reader, like, very slow that I have to reread it thrice and one chatgpt later to understand the context, so this probably inspired me to read, read, and read more in the summer, since I don't want to waste my time doing nothing again, because I'd  spend my last highschool summer learning on the things I wan't to learn.

            <p>
            <b>Introduction</b><br>
This is the first paragraph of your essay. It introduces the topic, grabs the reader's attention, and provides a thesis statement (the main idea or argument of your essay).
<br>
<b>Transitional Paragraph</b><br>
These are short paragraphs or sentences that connect different ideas or sections of your essay. They help the writing flow smoothly and guide the reader from one point to the next.
<br>
<b>Body</b><br>
This is the main part of your essay. It consists of several paragraphs that explain, support, or argue your thesis. Each paragraph focuses on one main idea or piece of evidence.
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
This is the last paragraph of your essay. It summarizes the main points, restates the thesis in a new way, and leaves the reader with a final thought or impression.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Back then, I would be unstoppable at making essays, but nowadays, it’s like my creativity for essays was stagnant, or even dwindled ever since the introduction of AI. I reflected on that day when there was an activity that I was so reliant on AI, prompting, asking, and giving ideas to AI, that my mind was basically enslaved by it... So, I just took a leap of faith, I didn’t use AI for essays after that. I did research and did the essay... And it even surprised me that I did all of that without relying on prompts and sticked with google searches and such. It was quite freeing, even I’ll admit I crammed that in 2 hours, I still managed to finish it just in time. The hardest for me in this subject was actually making an outline, like seriously, took me half a day to think what is a damn good outline that I basically bite a bullet on that one and did the essay first and outline last.<br>
This also made me reflect on actually how easy the lessons are being taught. But I’ll admit it, there were times that I’d just nod at you sir like I was listening when in fact my mind is pretty occupied with plans after going home (Seriously, afternoon classes are tiring). But then again, I relearned quite a lot actually about certain topics on how to make an essay and paragraphs and of course, who could forget the thesis statement, I always forgot how to make one (is it just me? I really need to get my memory checked...). But these days, I quite understood how to make one now since I don’t want to embarrass myself.

            <h3>Claim of fact</h3>
            <p align-text: justify; >- Asserts that something is true, either in the past, present, or future.
<br>
- It may not state an exact fact but can be supported by evidence or studies.
<br>
Past: Claiming something happened because of someone or something (e.g., "The invention of the internet revolutionized communication in the 20th century").
<br>
Present: Asserting something is true right now (e.g., "Climate change is causing more frequent natural disasters").
<br>
Future: Predicting something will happen (e.g., "Renewable energy will dominate global power sources by 2050").</p>

            <h3>Claim of Value</h3>
            <p>- Involves personal judgments, biases, or preferences about what is good or bad, right or wrong.
<br>
- Reflects subjective opinions rather than objective facts.
<br>
Examples:
<br><br>
"Classical music is more sophisticated than modern pop music."
<br>
"Social media has a negative impact on mental health."

            <p>Suggests what should or should not be done, proposing a specific action or change.
<br>
Often uses words like should, should not, must, must not.
<br>
Examples:
<br><br>
"Governments should invest more in public transportation to reduce traffic congestion."
<br>
"Schools must not allow the use of smartphones during class hours."</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Quite an easy topic, confusing when there’s a test about it, ugh! So infuriating. When you think it was a claim of value, it is actually FACT; and when you think it is a fact, it is actually a claim of VALUE. Like what the hell man? This was also the time where we’re to made an essay about I don’t know, natural resources? And we have to have claim of fact, policy and value. At that time, since you sir, won’t come back to class, the others decided to go home meanwhile me and my friend decided to stay at the Payag. While doing our essays there, we’re actually quite surprised to know that you came back... Oh god this is going to be bad I think to myself... Thinking what’s to come if we don’t come back... We decided to go back to the room and expected the worse... But... Nothing happened, just pure silence... And we’re only allowed to leave unless we show our essay. At that time, doing my essay was hard since, there’s basically no internet. So, since I just wanna get out of there to finish this essay, I stood up, walk to you and gave my uncompleted essay which, you pointed out... “what’s the Thesis statement on this essay...”. It dawned to me... What the hell is a thesis statement again? I stood there silent... And then... You just let me go, just pointing out that mistake... God, I just want to be gone there. Well, Lesson learned, learn what you’re taught.

            <p>
                Since we have the privilege to have freedom of speech to express our opinions on our reflection. Let’s just say that the first meeting was very tense. I heard rumors from sources I won’t disclose that you, sir, were somewhat of a strict teacher, something like that. First day and already, we were bombarded with a lot of questions about the topic, where, we were pointed by our names to answer, albeit such simple questions. It was quite a scare this is quite an unusual teaching style since every topic that is discussed a minuite ago; I sometimes ask questions like “What if I got it wrong?” since the aura you're emitting is quite heavy, It made me quite hella anxious.
                <br>
The lesson I learned on the class is that if you don’t listen and doze off, you’re pretty much screwed and have nothing to answer on the question (unless you have good long-term memory on your previous lessons) no one’s going to help you. Reading is another important skill that we need to learn. Reading allows us to understand and connect with the writers words and learn new words you may not even know of. I’ll admit it, I am a very slow reader, like, very slow that I have to reread it thrice and one chatgpt later to understand the context, so this probably inspired me to read, read, and read more in the summer, since I don't want to waste my time doing nothing again, because I'd  spend my last highschool summer learning on the things I wan't to learn.
